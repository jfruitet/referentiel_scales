With this plugin you car force conversion and move documents from Moodle 1.9 old file system to the Moodle 2.X new one.

You may choose to keep old files for archive or delete them (a better choice to spare data space on server)

N.B. : Il the number of files is very hight (more than 3000), conversion process takes a lot of time.
You have to adapt php.ini settings

* max_execution_time = 5000

* memory_limit = 1024M

If you get a \'Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 284205254 bytes)\'
try one mor time the conversion process.';
